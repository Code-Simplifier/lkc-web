      "I feel privileged to welcome you to Lyallpur Khalsa College, Jalandhar the century old premier multidisciplinary educational institution of Northern India. The institution in its eventful history has been a witness to the British colonial era and the subsequent Indian freedom struggle resulting in its independence and the bloody partition which forced it to get uprooted from its birth place and settle in a new land. During all this upheaval, the institution has unswervingly continued to work with its original mission – to provide socially, culturally and spiritually rooted useful education to the youth of the region, without any discrimination on the basis of race, religion, region, caste or gender. Of its total student strength which comes from diverse sections of society, about 40% are women students. The institution with its academically rich faculty, regularly updated and appropriate infrastructure, beautiful green campus, well maintained playgrounds and effective work culture provides an ideal ambience for the multifaceted growth of its students, which is reflected in the long and impressive list of its alumni. Moving along the principle of Think Globally and Act Locally, the institution offers a wide range of courses ranging from traditional to modern in content, and academic and professional in orientation, and is all set to move ahead with the National Education Policy 2020. I assure you that your academic experience at Lyallpur Khalsa College will be a rewarding one.",
